- ### 🔈We publish the source code of Coral， 2024-10-30. 

## Example to Run the Codes
To run the codes using the Junyi dataset:
1. Navigate to the code directory:
   ```
   cd Coral/Coral
   ```
2. Create two folders '/model' and '/result':
   ```
   mkdir model
   mkdir result
   ```

3. Train and test RCD model:
